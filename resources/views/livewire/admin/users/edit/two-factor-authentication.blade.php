                <p>Add additional security to your account using two-factor authentication.</p>

                <p><b>Why do I need this?</b></p>

                <p>Passwords can get stolen â€“ especially if you use the same password for multiple sites.
                Adding Two-Step Verification means that even if your password gets stolen, your account will remain secure.</p>

                <p><b>How does it work?</b></p>

                <p>After you turn on Two-Step Verification for your account, signing in will be a little different:
                    You'll enter your password, as usual.</p>

                <p>Next open your Authenticator app and copy the code number into the form and submit.</p>
